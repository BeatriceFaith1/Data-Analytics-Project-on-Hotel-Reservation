This project represents my second business data analytics project at Techzone Academy, focusing on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover key insights regarding room types, booking trends, and customer behaviors. The dataset includes features such as booking ID, number of adults, children, nights booked, meal plans, parking space requirements, room types, and booking statuses. The goal was to identify patterns and trends that can help businesses in the hospitality industry optimize their strategies to improve occupancy, maximize revenue, and reduce booking cancellations. By analyzing this data, I sought to provide actionable insights that could support data-driven decision-making and enhance business performance in the hotel industry.

The hospitality industry faces challenges in optimizing room utilization, minimizing cancellations, and attracting repeat customers. Underutilized room types and a high rate of booking cancellations are significant issues for businesses in this sector. Additionally, many hotels focus primarily on acquiring new guests, often neglecting customer retention efforts. These challenges hinder business growth and revenue stability. Through this project, I aimed to address these challenges by analyzing booking patterns to identify trends that can help businesses better understand customer preferences, optimize room offerings, and enhance retention strategies.

This project is significant because it showcases how data analytics can play a crucial role in improving business strategies in the hospitality industry. By analyzing booking data, businesses can uncover insights that drive informed decisions about room pricing, marketing, and customer engagement. The findings from this analysis can help businesses reduce cancellations, increase occupancy rates, and ultimately improve profitability. Furthermore, the project highlights the importance of customer retention, offering practical strategies to address low repeat customer rates and enhance long-term business sustainability.

The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, a widely recognized platform for data science and machine learning datasets. The dataset contains various columns related to hotel bookings, such as booking ID, the number of adults and children, meal types, room types, lead time, arrival details, booking status, and more. The analysis process began with cleaning the data, which involved removing duplicates to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the dataset. I also renamed certain columns, such as "Room Type 1," which was changed to "Room 1" for better clarity and ease of reference. Additionally, I created a date hierarchy with Year, Month, and Day, which facilitated time-series analysis and allowed me to explore booking trends over time, thus identifying seasonal patterns that could inform business decisions.

After cleaning the data, I used Power BI to conduct the data analysis and create visualizations. Power BI was an ideal tool for exploring relationships within the data and generating dynamic charts that helped to illustrate key findings. Through this analysis, I examined important factors such as booking trends by month, the performance of different room types, and cancellation rates. The visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs, allowed me to identify trends in customer behavior, such as which room types were most popular, how bookings varied throughout the year, and which segments of the customer base were most profitable.

The analysis revealed several key insights. Room Type 1 was identified as the most profitable, generating nearly £3 million in revenue. This suggests that Room Type 1 is a core offering that should continue to be marketed effectively to maintain its high demand. Conversely, Room Type 6 had the highest average price, around £200, which made it the most expensive room type. This suggests that Room Type 6 could be marketed as a premium offering, with additional exclusive features or amenities to appeal to high-net-worth individuals. Additionally, booking trends showed that weekends were more popular than weekdays, particularly in months like April and from July to October, indicating that external factors such as holidays or events influence booking behavior. Moreover, a significant portion of bookings, 96.04%, came from special guests, while only 3.96% came from repeat customers, highlighting the need for strategies to increase customer retention. The cancellation rate was another critical finding, with 32.78% of bookings being canceled, underscoring the need to address this issue to ensure more consistent revenue.

Based on these findings, several recommendations were made. First, promotional campaigns could be launched during off-peak months, such as May and July, to stimulate demand and fill rooms during slower periods. Additionally, Room Type 6, with its higher price point, could be marketed as a premium offering, perhaps with exclusive packages or personalized services to attract affluent customers. Further investigation into why certain room types, like Room Types 2, 5, and 7, are underutilized could lead to improved occupancy rates. Strengthening online marketing strategies and collaborating with other businesses for cross-promotions could also drive bookings, especially from the large online customer segment. Additionally, the high percentage of bookings from new customers highlights the need for loyalty programs to retain repeat customers and reduce reliance on acquiring new guests. Lastly, addressing the high cancellation rate through more flexible booking policies and improved communication with customers could help stabilize revenue and reduce the negative impact of cancellations.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in uncovering valuable insights that can influence business decisions. By analyzing booking data and identifying patterns in room type performance, booking trends, and customer behavior, businesses can optimize their operations and enhance their strategies for revenue generation and customer retention. The recommendations provided, such as targeted marketing campaigns, room type optimization, and customer loyalty programs, can help businesses in the hospitality sector address common challenges and improve their overall performance. Through the application of data-driven strategies, businesses can achieve greater stability, profitability, and long-term success in a competitive market.
